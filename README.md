## Nicolás J. Engler

```js
  const Nico = {
    name: 'Nicolás',
    currentPosition: 'Technical Product Manager',
    pronouns: 'he/him',
    bio: 'I’m a digital product designer that also happens to do a bunch of other stuff. From Argentina 🇦🇷.'
  }
```

To be quite frank, like I previously stated, I tend to do a lot of different activities and tasks. Sometimes I write short stuff, and sometimes I write longer stuff. I will most likely forget to update my internet-y resumé, and every once in a while I like to upload pictures of what I do to an online photo album. Oh, right! I also founded a small little agency.

### 💪. Partnership
I’ve worked with brands and institutions such as Red Bull, Mount Sinai, Montessori, CSS Design Awards, Precision Nutrition, SMS Tech, HALFBIT, and others. Let’s partner up.

### 📚. Strengths
I’m one part creative, one part logic. I have worked as a front-end developer, UI/UX/graphic designer, product designer, just to name a few positions and responsibilities. Let’s expand our skillset.

### 🤓. Experimentation
I’m in a neverending state of experimentation in order to test cutting edge tech, check any of my actual work and experiments on sites such as [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/nicolasjengler/), [CodePen](https://codepen.com/nicolasjengler/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasjengler/). Go on, take a look.
